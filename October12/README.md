## Thoughts on the Production
The production assignment took more time and trouble than I expected. Besides technical implementation, one key point is to coordinate between the RC and robotâ€™s movement, and make sure the person has full control of things. There were many conditions of movement to be considered. Driving the robot was also not easy, because one needed to balance the attention on the robot and on the control. That means the awareness and execution of control might happen unconsciously, which requires practice. 

In addition, we found our scrap wood (which worked quite well before) got in the way because it caused the robot to be stuck if the floor was uneven. We replaced one of our scrap wood with a thinner one. It worked better but in turn the robot would stagger a bit when suddenly stopped because of inertia.
