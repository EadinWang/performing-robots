## Thoughts on the Production
The production assignment took more time and trouble than I expected. Besides technical implementation, one key point is to coordinate between the RC and robot’s movement, and make sure the person has full control of things. There were many conditions of movement to be considered. Driving the robot was also not easy, because one needed to balance the attention on the robot and on the control. That means the awareness and execution of control might happen unconsciously, which requires practice. 

In addition, we found our scrap wood (which worked quite well before) got in the way because it caused the robot to be stuck if the floor was uneven. We replaced one of our scrap wood with a thinner one. It worked better but in turn the robot would stagger a bit when suddenly stopped because of inertia. 


## Reading Response
### Thinking Something Makes It So - Louise LePage

This chapter appears more philosophical, with much talking about ontology and epistemology. As I see it, it’s a kind of human’s self-reflection confronting the increasingly close human robot relationship. There seems to be an inevitable direction of more exposure with robots. The human nature of being curious about, evaluating and exploring approaches to ‘the other’ results in robots coming to stage. Moving forward from computers, robots become the “test object” for humans. And maybe, we are ultimately testing ourselves. 

Emotional expression is again highlighted. The author mentions that Geminoid F’s lack of eye contact makes it neither alive nor human. Does that mean machines/robots can be not human but alive? What’s the difference between being alive and being conscious? If robots become both alive (and conscious), what distinct ourselves as humans?

The author proposes that androids’ character is key to increase empathy, such as personal qualities, roles and identities. I think this also results from humans’ imaginative nature. I really like the point that imagination upon the robot arises from and circulates in people’s conventions and ideas of characters. This interaction between performers and convention and ideas helps complete the impression and perception of agents. This can happen not only in theaters. We always associate things with our previous cognition and experiences. 

I’m not sure why the fact that performing robots refuse the dichotomies between ‘fictional character’ and ‘real actor’ results in the conclusion that humans are posthumanist, and even cyborgs. Is it because no matter how complex a robot becomes, it will still be regarded as cyborgs? Ultimately, we come back to this question: What makes the human human?
