### Towards a Dramaturgy of Robots and Object-Figures
For most of the discussion in this article, there’s a pre-assumption that virtual figures and robots can seamlessly replicate humans. 

New Media Dramaturgy brought up the trend of using projection, screens and other media. Here the robot is an object-figure parallel to virtual figures, and the objects can all activate sensibilities and operate on expressive dynamics. The point is that physical robots have pushed media into a more material direction. We now acknowledge the materiality of robots, while seeing them more than metaphors. 

NMD characterizes contemporary human-robot relationships: Not just anthropomorphism or projection of human emotions, but further to understand a new mode of subjectivity. That is to say, there’s no ontological hierarchy but only either intimacy or conflict that is equal and unprecedented. 

Hirata Oriza’s robot theater theories appear to be quite vanward, in a way that there is no binary between human and robot any more. Therefore there’s not even such notions of “replacing” or “competing”, but only parallel existence. 

I can understand, theoretically, changing relations between humans and objects makes each other flexible in ontological existence, and so dramaturgy of robots (and also humans) is under constant rearrangement. However I feel it’s hard to grasp when people really look into the physical stage. I wonder how we would merge the gap between the theoretical imagination and reality. Maybe it will just happen in the coming decades. 

It’s thought-provoking that the article ends with “the needs of the machine.” For all the experiments we are doing, are they more responsive to humans or machines? Do we really want to cater to machine needs?
