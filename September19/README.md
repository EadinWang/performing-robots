### On Stage: Robots as Performers

Important Points: 

- Humans are sensitive not only to the content, symbols, and categories of interaction, but also to their timing.
- Theater and performance robotics as good testing ground for HRI (action coordination), mainly because of: 

  1. Controllability: constrained by script, settings etc.; rich environment
  2. Form: on the scene; verbal & nonverbal communication; audience is sensitive 


- Modern theater theory provides insights for human-robot coordination: **continuity and responsiveness**

- Stage continuity comes not merely from memorizing lines, but also analyzing a scene and creating inner monologue. 

  - Endowing an HRI robot with such an “inner monologue” might -> more natural and continuous interaction -> avoid the command-and-response behavior -> more fluency and acceptance

  - Gestures and motions serve for the appeal and the readability of the robot’s internal processes.

Questions: 
1. Theaters are good testing grounds, but would there be gaps between the experiments in robotic theater and real-world interactions? For example, while acting emphasizes fluency, excessive fluency might feel fake in reality. 
2. Does the emphasis on continuity and responsiveness highlight that we want to make robots more human-like? Linking back to what we read last week, are we constructing privilege over non-human beings? 
3. Similarly, we make human-robot coordination more and more fluent, then what’s our ultimate purpose? Are we making robots, as objects, further serve human needs, or seeking ways of co-existence? What role do we expect robots to play?
