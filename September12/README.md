##Chapter 5: Robots: Asleep, Awake, Alone, and in Love - New Media Dramaturgy Performance Media and New-Materialism

###Interesting points for me: 
1. The power of concept: 
**Hyperobject:** filled with an abundance of agents (gyre of plastic bags/climate change), demand nothing from humans, repellent to humans.
**Protosubject:** remains human-scaled. -> possibility of encounter alive

In the virtual domains of art and theatre, the ontological values of actants are less fixed. -> we question if the indistinguishable boundary between human and machine is realizable.


###New arguments on HRI for me: 
Robots represent indifferences of gender and race, expressing nostalgia for the ‘good old days’ of racial purity and hyper-conformity. (Robertson)

Humans still rely on emotional responses to interpret the ‘thing-ness’ of the object rather than creating alternative ways of encountering and engaging with it.

Human-like features can be a kind of narcissism from human-being. Anthropomorphic perception can/should promote empathetic engagement instead of privilege over non-human. 

###Thoughts & Questions: 	
1. Why are mis-performances meaningful in terms of the complexity of synchronicity?
2. Is it ethically right when we sense empathy in robots, considering robots cannot actually feel it and are still serving human needs? 
3. The article mentions that if robots have emotions or consciousness doesn’t matter, because humans project emotions on them (e.x. teddy bears). However, I think the instinct of projecting emotions results from the fact that the object’s figure indicates familiarity, or clues of emotion (not necessarily anthropomorphic), because we can hardly do that to a completely strange and scary object. Does that mean we will always fall back on emotional connections?
4. *Human communication is concentrated on stimuli such as spontaneous facial expressions and an ability to be responsive to interactive situations.* The article refers to this human characteristic as evolutionarily imperfect, is it too self-blaming? Every species relies on their own way of communication. 
5. *“However, a dualism suggests that there is tension, opposition, and perhaps the potential for exchange, (possibly even) politicisation, and response. With symbiosis it seems that it is all over: the battle has been fought, tensions resolved, and we have merged or have a relationship that benefits both elements – in this case subject and machine.”*
Why must there be “battles” fought beforehand before symbiosis? There seems to be an order between opposition and symbiosis. Do we expect to experience that order (tension to reconciliation) or just want to seek a beneficial relationship while avoiding risk?
