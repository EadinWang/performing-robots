Non-verbal communication is key to understanding sociability, and is rooted in every aspect of life conditions involving social interactions. Such moments filled with social and emotional exchange are vital for theater robots as they aim to evoke dramaturgy effect. It also functions as testbeds for human non-verbal behavior. 

The eight lessons are: 
1. Robots using relatable gestures can clarify current activity goals and improve camaraderie; 
2. Human affect expressions derive from our physicality, thus robots are uniquely capable of leveraging their embodiment to communicate on human terms; 
3. Theater provides encodings for movement metaphors such that robot actions might mirror onto ourselves;
4. Human perception is a better benchmark for a robot’s social design than internal AI; 
5. A machine must convey social intelligence to make the leap from object to agent; 
6. Theater settings provide a unique testing ground for developing multi-agent interactions with a third party; 
7. Audiences provide useful visceral and conscious feedback data to social robots in development; 
8. Machine humor, though difficult to design, is highly impactful to interaction and a fertile domain for interdisciplinary collaboration.

To achieve some goals there are direct and peripheral approaches. In terms of showing intentions, the robot can either show by behaviors directly or show adverse reactions for failure. The timing profiles in "look, reach, grab" also indicate motivation, emotionality and social meaning. Therefore, readability in intentions and reactions is an important aspect for us to pay attention to. Furthermore, “outward intentionality outweighs an actor’s internal feelings, and the two may be out of sync.” This actually made me feel a bit bad because robots here are made to have fake feelings in order for its performance contribution to the larger interaction. In fact, the word “robot” means “forced labor/slave” in R.U.R, the Cezch play by Karel Čapek, as the originality of the modern reference of robot. 

I hold doubts on the idea of “behavior precedes feeling.” Based on what I understand, the point is that the body is the essential mode of communication and enhancement of expression. If the robot’s body is not fully leveraged, it’s less likely to have strong expression of feelings. However, as I remembered in the movie _Her_, the character did construct a strong emotional relationship with an AI who has no physical presence. The point of having a physical body as I see it, though, is to convey expressions that are more familiar to humans, because we are used to communicating with tangible creatures. 

Indeed I think those lessons are not only useful and valuable in theater robot development but also in human non-verbal/verbal communication. We should show clear intentions, give acknowledgement and feedback, and probably make use of humor, etc. This is one of the reasons why I like learning about human-robot interaction and human-machine relationship, that what we study and find out ultimately go back to influence how we understand ourselves as humans.
