### Digital Theater - The ‘Other’ Actor

#### 3 types of digital actor: Digital Puppets / Video Actors / Mechanical Actors

Dancing like marionettes can be appreciated: “humans should dance like marionettes and marionettes like humans.” ***Does it somehow show a kind of fetish/fetishism from humans?*** 
In the end, there seems to be a mutual mimicry between humans and puppets. 

The concept of “partnership” would be formed as each adjusted to the movements of the other, and the co-presence of live and media characters can give a “sense of presence”/life to extinct characters.

! But if the characters had been animated first, live actors would become a slave to them because they need to rehearse and time themselves. -> Instead, it’s better that the motion and life of the puppet is created by a real actor and transferred to it, which also -> improvisational fluidity. 
-> ***What’s the relationship between the backstage original actor, the digital puppet that is replicating, and the reacting live actor? How does authorship work in this scenario?*** 

Robots displacing humans and actors
Two possibilities: (1) When robots can act as well or better than humans, there will be people who will crave performances by genuine humans. (2) As robots become more human-like, humans may become more robotic. (Gharavi)
-> ***What problems might be caused in the two situations? Even if people crave genuine human performances, are they regarded as more advanced or outdated?*** 

***If we choose to embrace robots’ limitations, what are potential benefits and drawbacks? 
“Are we ready for what we are making?” What kind of principles should we stick to and what precautions/preparations should be done?*** 

#### Other observations: 
- There seems to be a progress of alienness of robots - mechanical actors as the highest. 
- Interaction is key to performances between human and nonhuman actors. 
- Doubling the actor onstage with his/her own image can lead to the uncanny and self-introspection, which also answers why we should be cautious about replicating humans by robots. 
- Apart from the testbeds for HRI, this article also highlights robot theater’s function for public acceptance of robots.
